# SurrviveNuclearBomb

SurrviveNuclearBomb is a game inspired by game "60 seconds".

This game is written in C++ and uses the cocos2d-x game engine. This project was part of the advanced programming class at the Panaamericana University Bonaterra Campus.
The game has 10 different levels, with different types of destinations, and in each level you have to make decisions to survive and move on to the next level (day), but you must be careful to keep your characters alive.
